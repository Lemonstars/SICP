## Exercise 1.34  

The interpreter reponses:  
`;The object 2 is not applicable.`  
`;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:`  
`; (RESTART 2) => Specify a procedure to use in its place.`  
`; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.`  

The process is followed:  
==> (f f)  
==> (f 2)  
==> (2 2)
